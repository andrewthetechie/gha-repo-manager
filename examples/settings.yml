# settings.yml can live in two places:
# 1. in the repo itself
# 2. in a centralized repo

# The Action is able to apply settings to any repo that its token can manage
# You can run Action from each repo, acting on that repo's settings.yml, or
# from a central repo, using a single settings.yml to control many repos.

# Which method you choose is up to you. See README.md for more info and example
# Workflows to implement these strategies.
settings:
  # See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#update-a-repository for all available settings.
  # any of these settings can be ommitted to just leave the repo's current setting
  # If a setting has a value in settings.yml, it will always overwrite what exists in the repo.
